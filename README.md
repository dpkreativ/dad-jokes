## My process

### Built with

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [ZenRows API](https://www.zenrows.com/) - For scraping Reddit
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - For type safety
- Fetch API - For HTTP requests

### What I learned

- How to fetch data on the server-side with Next.js and render it on the frontend.
- The ZenRows API is great for scraping data from websites without needing to set up complex scraping logic.
- Handling asynchronous data fetching with TypeScript for better error handling and type safety.

### Current UI
